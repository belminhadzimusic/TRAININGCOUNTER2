# TRAININGCOUNTER2
Training-Counter
This counter is aimed to all people with high interest in sport . Since sport is one of major aspects in life , I decided to make this application. To help people get better timing in sport, during their training. When we open the app, there will be app name and button start for starting the app. When we press start new window is opening. In that new window we will have a list of options such as: Stopwatch ,push Ups ,abs. Stopwatch will be designed to fit perfectly within this app. Stopwatch main purpose is to measure an amount of time.
When we choose first option, there will be new window with Stopwatch and Back button. When we press back button it will return us to list options mentioned above. Below stopwatch there will be three buttons: Pause , Reset and Lap. If we use lap , in modal window we would have it as message. After finishing we would be able to see all laps. Above stopwatch will be time written/ timing. In case we have choose push ups , we will have two available options:
1. push ups counter and video or description how to do them properly 2. when we choose push up counter it will counts us push ups. Same will happen if we choose abs ,we will have stopwatch anf video / pictures or description how to do it properly.
